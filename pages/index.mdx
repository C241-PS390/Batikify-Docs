# Welcome to Batikify!

Batik is a rich cultural heritage of Indonesia, filled with historical value and uniqueness. One of
its distinguishing features is the diversity of its types. Batik patterns vary not only in motifs,
shapes, and colors but also carry their own meanings and stories behind each design. Despite this
richness, public understanding or knowledge about batik remains minimal. This is particularly
evident in the current digital era, where many aspects of traditional culture are being influenced
by ongoing modernization. On the flip side, in this digital age, advancements in computer vision
technology have created new opportunities to preserve and introduce batik to a wider audience.

Based on this premise, our team has formulated the question: "How can artificial intelligence
technology be applied to help enhance the knowledge and interest of Indonesian society in the
cultural heritage of batik?". Therefore, we are planning to develop an AI-based batik pattern
classifier application. To preserve and promote the richness of batik, an application that can
automatically recognize and classify batik motifs holds significant value.
