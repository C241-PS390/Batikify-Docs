# Getting Started

There are two ways to use our API.

## Use the Deployed Version

We already deployed our API that can be accessed at:

https://batikify-api-wk3br75jlq-et.a.run.app

From there, now you can explore our API based on later documentation.

## Use the Development

To use the development version, you can go to our GitHub at top-right corner of page and search for
[Batikify-API Repo](https://github.com/C241-PS390/Batikify-API) and then follow these steps:

1. Run git clone to clone our repo using

   ```bash copy
   git clone https://github.com/C241-PS390/Batikify-API.git
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` file and customize it based on your needs

   ```bash copy
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   `.env.example` content

   ```env
   PROJECT_ID=
   HISTORY_STORAGE_NAME=

3. Install the dependencies and run it using `start:dev` for using nodemon and `start` for general
