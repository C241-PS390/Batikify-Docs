# Getting Started

There are two ways to use our API.

## Use the Deployed Version

We already deployed our API that can be accessed at:

https://batikify-api-wk3br75jlq-et.a.run.app

From there, now you can explore our API based on later documentation.

## Use the Development Version

To use the development version, you can go to our GitHub at top-right corner of page and search for
[Batikify-API Repo](https://github.com/C241-PS390/Batikify-API) and then follow these steps:

1. Run git clone to clone our repo using

   ```bash copy
   git clone https://github.com/C241-PS390/Batikify-API.git
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` file and customize it based on your needs

   ```bash copy
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   `.env.example` content

   ```.env copy
   PROJECT_ID=
   HISTORY_STORAGE_NAME=
   MODEL_URL=
   JWT_SECRET=
   PORT=8080
   ```

3. Provide your own Google Cloud service account that have editor access of:

   - Cloud Storage Admin (or can edit object in Cloud Storage)
   - Cloud Datastore Admin (or can edit data in Firestore)
   - Service Account User

   After that, store it at `./src/services/serviceAccount.json`

4. Install the dependencies and run it using `start:dev` for using nodemon and `start` for general
   ```bash copy
   npm i
   npm run start:dev
   ```
